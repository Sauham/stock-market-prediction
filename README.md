This project focuses on predicting stock market prices using historical data. The project leverages machine learning models, including ARIMA and Gradient Boosting Regressor, to forecast stock prices for selected tickers. The data is fetched using the `yfinance` library, and the analysis is performed using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `statsmodels`.
